        "So in this article, we'll be looking at how to write a star-formation simulation in Python. Sure, the topic may sound intimidating on first glance, but it's actually pretty simple and straightforward to implement. All you need to know are some basic programming in Python 3 and the fundamentals of vector algebra. An understanding of calculus is a plus, but isn't absolutely essential. We won't be deriving equations, but rather using them directly without proof. This article aims to be as beginner-friendly as possible. If you get stuck somewhere, feel free to reach out to me for clarifications.\n",

        "First things first. What exactly _is_ a simulation? A computer simulation is basically just a fancy way of saying that we're using computers to imititate a real-world process. Here, the real world process we're interested in is that of star formation. In order to imitate the real-world process, we either take a rule-based approach or solve our governing equations. Given that star formation is an actively-studied topic in astrophysics with plenty of equations describing the same, we will be taking the latter approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike us, computers can't really sit and work out the solutions to an equation on their own. So, we use different \"schemes\" to solve our governing equations. Here, we'll be using a technique known as \"Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics\" in order to solve our equations and run the simulation. The equations are in their vector form.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "Given that we're using Python to solve our equations, we use NumPy to speed up the vector calculations and MatPlotLib to view the simulation results. I will be linking tutorials for the same at the end of the article, and would strongly suggest you check them out to get a better understanding for how these libraries work."

        "\n",
        "Through our observations of the night sky, we know that there's a lot of gas in outer space, just floating around. We also know that stars burn this gas to produce light, through nuclear fusion. What we're trying to figure out, is how a gas cloud goes from just floating around in space, to collapsing on itself and starting nuclear fusion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Broadly speaking, there are 5 major steps in the formation of a star as identified by astronomers. They are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. There's a cloud of molecular gas which doesn't collapse on itself by virtue of the motion of its particles. The gas just has pressure, no gravity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Something (we don't know what, yet) triggers the gas to form lumps, which in turn leads to gravity dominating over the pre existing pressure.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. These clumps of gas merge together and gain mass, slowly forming protostars, with a positive feedback loop where the more clumps joins together, the heavier it gets, attracting more clumps.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. As the clumps start aggregating, the gas glob starts rotating, eventually flattening out (due to it's moment of inertia) and formimg the circumstellar disk. This disk contains two parts, the accretion disk and the protoplanetary disk.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. The accretion disk gets pressurized till the gas starts a fusion reaction. This initial fusion reaction sends out a strong wind through the protoplanetary disc, helping the remaining matter aggregate to form planets and asteroids, while the fusion reaction starts heating up the gas and forming a stable star.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Our simulation will look at a dark cloud, and study how the gravitational collapse might occur. Subsequent steps will require an in-depth understanding of thermodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics, among other things, and are hence beyond the scope of this article.

In our case, we model the clumps of gas as homogenous through interpolation and analytical differentiation.

This is in contrast to traditional fluid dynamics solvers, which make use of meshing and the finite volume approach.\n",
